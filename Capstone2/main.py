Sure, let's go through the columns and the totals at the bottom in detail:

### Columns Explained:

1. **ICD 10**: The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. Each code represents a specific type of cancer.

2. **SITE**: The location in the body where the cancer is found (e.g., Colorectal, Liver, Breast, etc.).

3. **NO.**: The number of reported cases for each type of cancer. For example, there are 7,646 cases of colorectal cancer.

4. **%**: The percentage of total cancer cases that each type represents. For example, colorectal cancer cases make up 16.4% of all reported cancer cases.

5. **CR (Crude Rate)**: The number of new cancer cases per 100,000 people in a given time period, without adjusting for age. For colorectal cancer, this rate is 11.7.

6. **CR74**: The Crude Rate for individuals aged 0-74. For colorectal cancer, this rate is 1.8.

7. **ASR (Age-Standardized Rate)**: This rate is adjusted to a standard age distribution, allowing comparisons between populations with different age structures. For colorectal cancer, the ASR is 14.6.

8. **(ASR 95%CL)**: The 95% Confidence Limits for the ASR. This range indicates where the true ASR is likely to fall with 95% confidence. For colorectal cancer, the ASR is between 14.2 and 14.9.

9. **CumR (Cumulative Risk)**: The risk of developing cancer over a certain period (often up to age 75 or over a lifetime). For colorectal cancer, the cumulative risk is 1.8%.

### Totals at the Bottom:

1. **All sites Total**: This row summarizes the data for all types of cancer combined.

    - **NO. (46,794)**: The total number of reported cancer cases across all sites.
    
    - **% (100)**: This shows that the total percentage of cancer cases across all sites is 100%, confirming that the sum of percentages for individual cancer sites should add up to 100%.
    
    - **CR (71.4)**: The overall Crude Rate for all cancer cases combined is 71.4 per 100,000 people.
    
    - **CR74 (10.3)**: The overall Crude Rate for individuals aged 0-74 for all cancer cases combined is 10.3.
    
    - **ASR (86.9)**: The overall Age-Standardized Rate for all cancer cases combined is 86.9 per 100,000 people.
    
    - **(ASR 95%CL, 86.1-87.7)**: We are 95% confident that the true ASR for all cancer cases combined is between 86.1 and 87.7.
    
    - **CumR (9.8)**: The cumulative risk of developing any type of cancer over a certain period is 9.8%.

### Interpretation:

- The **ICD 10** and **SITE** columns specify the type and location of each cancer.
- The **NO.** column shows how many cases were reported for each type of cancer.
- The **%** column helps understand the proportion of each cancer type relative to the total number of cancer cases.
- The **CR** and **CR74** columns provide the crude incidence rates, while the **ASR** gives a more comparable rate adjusted for age differences.
- The **(ASR 95%CL)** column provides a confidence interval for the ASR, showing the precision of this estimate.
- The **CumR** column gives an estimate of the lifetime risk of developing each cancer type.

The total row helps to understand the overall burden of cancer across all sites, providing a comprehensive view of the data.
